// PolyFunc is an interface for functions which are statically polymorphic. In

// implementing what would appear to be generic or polymorphic instead something
// that is actually static and that still has the language safety properties.

	Func // implement everything in Func but add the additional requirements

	// Polymorphisms returns a list of possible function type signatures. It
	// takes as input a list of partial "hints" as to limit the number of
	// possible results it returns. These partial hints take the form of a
	// function type signature (with as many types in it specified and the
	// rest set to nil) and any known static values for the input args. If
	// the partial type is not nil, then the Ord parameter must be of the
	// correct arg length. If any types are specified, then the array must
	// be of that length as well, with the known ones filled in. Some
	// static polymorphic functions require a minimal amount of hinting or
	// they will be unable to return any possible result that is not
	// infinite in length. If you expect to need to return an infinite (or
	// very large) amount of results, then you should return an error
	// instead. The arg names in your returned func type signatures should
	// be in the standardized "a..b..c" format. Use util.NumToAlpha if you
	// want to convert easily.

	// Build takes the known type signature for this function and finalizes
	// this structure so that it is now determined, and ready to function as
	// a normal function would. (The normal methods in the Func interface
	// are all that should be needed or used after this point.)
	Build(*types.Type) error // then, you can get argNames from Info()
