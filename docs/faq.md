# Frequently asked questions

(Send your questions as a patch to this FAQ! I'll review it, merge it, and
respond by commit with the answer.)

### Why did you start this project?

I wanted a next generation config management solution that didn't have all of
the design flaws or limitations that the current generation of tools do, and no
tool existed!

### Why did you use etcd? What about consul?

Etcd and consul are both written in golang, which made them the top two
contenders for my prototype. Ultimately a choice had to be made, and etcd was
chosen, but it was also somewhat arbitrary. If there is available interest,
good reasoning, *and* patches, then we would consider either switching or
supporting both, but this is not a high priority at this time.

### Can I use an existing etcd cluster instead of the automatic embedded servers?

Yes, it's possible to use an existing etcd cluster instead of the automatic,
elastic embedded etcd servers. To do so, simply point to the cluster with the
`--seeds` variable, the same way you would if you were seeding a new member to
an existing mgmt cluster.

The downside to this approach is that you won't benefit from the automatic
elastic nature of the embedded etcd servers, and that you're responsible if you
accidentally break your etcd cluster, or if you use an unsupported version.

### What does the error message about an inconsistent dataDir mean?

If you get an error message similar to:

```
Etcd: Connect: CtxError...
Etcd: CtxError: Reason: CtxDelayErr(5s): No endpoints available yet!
Etcd: Connect: Endpoints: []
Etcd: The dataDir (/var/lib/mgmt/etcd) might be inconsistent or corrupt.
```

This happens when there are a series of fatal connect errors in a row. This can
happen when you start `mgmt` using a dataDir that doesn't correspond to the
current cluster view. As a result, the embedded etcd server never finishes
starting up, and as a result, a default endpoint never gets added. The solution
is to either reconcile the mistake, and if there is no important data saved, you
can remove the etcd dataDir. This is typically `/var/lib/mgmt/etcd/member/`.

### Why do resources have both a `Compare` method and an `IFF` (on the UID) method?

The `Compare()` methods are for determining if two resources are effectively the
same, which is used to make graph change delta's efficient. This is when we want
to change from the current running graph to a new graph, but preserve the common
vertices. Since we want to make this process efficient, we only update the parts
that are different, and leave everything else alone. This `Compare()` method can
tell us if two resources are the same.

The `IFF()` method is part of the whole UID system, which is for discerning if a
resource meets the requirements another expects for an automatic edge. This is
because the automatic edge system assumes a unified UID pattern to test for
equality. In the future it might be helpful or sane to merge the two similar
comparison functions although for now they are separate because they are
actually answer different questions.

### Does this support Windows? OSX? GNU Hurd?

Mgmt probably works best on Linux, because that's what most developers use for
serious automation workloads. Support for non-Linux operating systems isn't a
high priority of mine, but we're happy to accept patches for missing features
or resources that you think would make sense on your favourite platform.

### Did you know that there is a band named `MGMT`?

I didn't realize this when naming the project, and it is accidental. After much
anguishing, I chose the name because it was short and I thought it was
appropriately descriptive. If you need a less ambiguous search term or phrase,
you can try using `mgmtconfig` or `mgmt config`.

It also doesn't stand for
[Methyl Guanine Methyl Transferase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-6-methylguanine-DNA_methyltransferase)
which definitely existed before the band did.

### You didn't answer my question, or I have a question!

It's best to ask on [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#mgmtconfig)
to see if someone can help you. Once we get a big enough community going, we'll
add a mailing list. If you don't get any response from the above, you can
contact me through my [technical blog](https://purpleidea.com/contact/)
and I'll do my best to help. If you have a good question, please add it as a
patch to this documentation. I'll merge your question, and add a patch with the
answer!
